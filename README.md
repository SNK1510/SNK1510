Hi! I am Srinanda Kurapati. You can call me Nanda :D

I am a graduate student in Business Analytics at University of Illinois at Chicago.

Currently a Data Analyst intern at Nokia 

I like the fact that even simple analysis and visualizations make data's understability from 'Bro, what's this?' to 'Dude, this is some cool stuff'

In the past I worked in Deloitte as a Business Technology Analyst and had some great technical learnings.

I love brainstorming and discussing new ideas with people, that is the beauty of networking, there's just so much to learn from each other! :)
