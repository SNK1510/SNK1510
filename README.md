Hi! I am Srinanda Kurapati. You can call me Nanda :D

I recently graduated from University of Illinois at Chicago, with a Master's degree in Business Analytics.

I like the fact that even simple analysis and visualizations make data's understability from 'Bro, what's this?' to 'Dude, this is some cool stuff'

In the past I worked in Nokia as a Data Analyst Intern and as a Business Technology Analyst at Deloitte and had some great technical learnings.

I love brainstorming and discussing new ideas with people, that is the beauty of networking, there's just so much to learn from each other! :)
